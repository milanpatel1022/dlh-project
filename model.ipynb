    "# Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "    - Paper: CNN-DDI\n",
    "    - I built off of the DDIMDL repo code (which was specified in the paper selection list) to follow this paper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of problem\n",
    "    - Predicting events associated to Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs)\n",
    "    - DDIs are the reactions between two or more drugs\n",
    "### Importance\n",
    "    - Unexpected DDIs can cause serious and unforeseen health issues\n",
    "    - Multiple drug consumption is becoming increasingly common\n",
    "    - The study of DDIs is important to drug discovery and development, but also for increasing the safety potential of patients who may be consuming multiple drugs\n",
    "### Difficulty\n",
    "    - In the past, DDIs were solely discovered through wet experiments\n",
    "    - This method is labor-intensive and time-consuming\n",
    "### Methods and effectiveness\n",
    "    - In recent years, databases containing large amounts of drug data have been constructed using information from literature and reports\n",
    "    - This has allowed for ML methods to be applied to this task of predicting DDI associated events, thereby reducing efforts, time, and cost\n",
    "### Paper Proposal\n",
    "    - This paper proposes a novel CNN architecture in the supervised learning approach to predicting DDIs\n",
    "### Paper Innovations\n",
    "    - This paper's innovations include the novel CNN architecture + utilizing a new drug feature that older papers haven't (called drug category) in training/prediction\n",
    "### Paper Metrics\n",
    "    - Outperforms all ML methods that came before it, including DDIMDL (DDIMDL was trained on different features)\n",
    "    - ACC      AUPR     AUC       F1       Precision    Recall\n",
    "      0.8871   0.9251   0.9980    0.7496   0.8556       0.7220\n",
    "### Paper Contribution to Research\n",
    "    - This paper's contribution is identfying that the CNN architecture along with the drug category feature, can allow for improved DDI predictions"

    "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Hypothesis 1\n",
    "    - Drugs with similar features will interact similarly\n",
    "    - Ex: If Drug A and B interact with each other and have a biological impact\n",
    "        - If Drug C is similar to A, it will likely interact with B in the same manner A does\n",
    "    - CNNs will capture patterns in the feature similarity scores of drugs and accurately predict interactions accordingly"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "***\n",
    "## IMPORTANT NOTE\n",
    "    - All data extraction, data processing, model, evaluation code is present in this notebook. main() will begin running the entire process.\n",
    "        - Each cell/section of code will be highlighted to what its high-level purpose is\n",
    "        - I understand the code is out of order of what the template specifies, but nonetheless, the implementations are all there\n",
    "        - I have added highly detailed comments throughout each and every part of the code for your understanding as well.\n",
    "    - Most of this code comes from the DDIMDL paper\n",
    "    - I have made several changes to remove bugs, unnecessary code, add detailed explanations, and to include the CNN architecture specified in CNN-DDI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "### Source\n",
    "    - DDIMDL repo (within the event.db file) -> ultimately sourced from DrugBank\n",
    "    - Drug table: contains 572 drugs and their features (id, target, enzyme, pathway, smile, name)\n",
    "    - Event table: 37264 DDIs between 572 drugs (id1, name1, id2, name2, interaction)\n",
    "    - Extraction table: each interaction transformed to tuple {mechanism, action, drugA, drugB} -> done using NLPProcess code from DDIMDL\n",
    "    - Event_number table: interaction/event mapped to its frequency\n",
    "### Data Process\n",
    "    - 4 (572x572) similarity matrices created and data split into training/test sets using 5-fold cross validation\n",
    "    - Why 4 matrices? 4 features to consider\n",
    "    - Why 572 x 572? Because 572 drugs\n",
    "    - In each feature matrix, each drug is represented by a binary vector\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "- I still need to implement the residual block/connection described in the paper (part of next steps)\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "    - 5 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers\n",
    "    - 2 max pooling layers in between\n",
    "### Activation functions\n",
    "    - ReLU activation used after each convolutional layer\n",
    "    - Softmax used in output layer\n",
    "## Training Objectives\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "    - Categorical Cross Entropy (aka Softmax Loss)\n",
    "### Optimizer\n",
    "    - Adam"

    "## Note\n",
    "    - Results should be taken with a grain of salt at this time. I was not able to get the drug category feature into my dataset\n",
    "    - The results are from only training using 3 features (smile, target, and enzyme) while the paper used 4 features (pathway, target, enzyme, category)\n",
    "## Stored in 2 Files\n",
    "    - First CSV: shows 11 performance metrics describing the the overall classification performance (11 rows, 1 column)\n",
    "    - Second CSV: shows 6 performance metrics describing the per-event classification performance (65 rows, 6 columns)\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "***\n",
    "Training epochs changed from 10 to 3 to demo that the model is properly training/learning\n",
    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "    - It's been somewhat reproducible so far. \n",
    "    - This paper has no code, so instead, the code from DDIMDL was used as the foundation\n",
    "    - The DDIMDL repo has already acquired the data and placed it into a database file\n",
    "    - CNN-DDI says it uses data acquired from DDIMDL\n",
    "    - However, CNN-DDI uses a new drug feature that is not present in the Drug table in the database\n",
    "    - Neither paper explained the data acquisition method, only where the data came from\n",
    "    - I have been unable to acquire that extra feature thus far.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## What was easy/difficult?\n",
    "    - It was difficult fully understanding the DDIMDL code so I can debug it and modify it to work with CNN architecture instead of the DNN it was using\n",
    "## Suggestions to authors\n",
    "    - Explain how the data was acquired\n",
    "    - Provide some code\n",
    "## What I will do in next phase\n",
    "    - Figure out how to get that drug category feature\n",
    "    - Add residual block/connection to CNN architecture"
